Before to use this toolbox you need:
1, MATLAB 2018 or later, with signal processing toolbox, wavelet toolbox, parallel computing toolbox.
2, Install the ripplelab toolbox. You can get the ripplelab from: https://github.com/BSP-Uniandes/RIPPLELAB
For more details, please refer:

RIPPLELAB: A Comprehensive Application for the Detection, Analysis and Classification of High Frequency Oscillations in Electroencephalographic Signals. PLoS One. 2016 Jun 24;11(6):e0158276. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0158276. PMID: 27341033; PMCID: PMC4920418.

Using this toolbox:
The input is a *.rhfe file, obtained from RippleLab
Run the code will begin with loading the *.rhfe file. When it is finished, a *_processed.rhfe file will be created.
The output can be loaded into ripplelab for a review.
